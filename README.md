## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use CSS grid view to make a three column card components instead of flexbox and I also learned how to use pseudo class and pseudo elements to make a hover button. In flexbox, the paragraphs couldn't be stable whenever they change a lay-out.

### Continued development

Doing this is a difficult one for me since I only knew a few CSS responsive properties so thanks to this challenge it was fulfilling because I learned a knew stuff again. 

### Useful resources

- [FreeCodeCamp Grid View](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_grid.asp) - This helped me on how to apply grid view in this challenge such as threee column component.
